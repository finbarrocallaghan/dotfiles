dotfiles
======


todo:

* double check for zsh in $PATH before setting in vimrc/tmux.conf
* check for existence of dirs etc before globbing
* ask for prompt and tmux whoami colour...
* make colours etc something individual to each machine, so not tracked in
  tmux.conf/zshrc have them read from a colors.local file or something
